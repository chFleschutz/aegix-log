#
# Checks removed:
# 
# -cppcoreguidelines-avoid-const-or-ref-data-members
#   TODO: Reevaluate this check
#   Removed because this caused issues which need to be resolved before re-enabling
#
# -cppcoreguidelines-avoid-magic-numbers
#   Removed because it is too strict
#   This check causes too many false positives, especially when using mathematical formulas
# 
# -cppcoreguidelines-macro-usage
#   TODO: Reevaluate this check
#   Removed because this project is based on macros and needs to be fixed before re-enabling
#
# -cppcoreguidelines-pro-bounds-array-to-pointer-decay
#   TODO: Reevaluate this check
#   Removed because this check clashes with certain template functions and needs to be fixed before re-enabling
#
# -misc-const-correctness
#   Removed because it causes too much noise
#   This check flags any variable that can be const, which is not always desirable 
#
# -misc-include-cleaner
#   TODO: Reevaluate this check
#   This was removed to reduce include dependencies, but it should be re-evaluated
#
# -performance-enum-size
#   Removed because it is too strict
#   This check flags basicly any enum (that is not a byte), which is not desirable
